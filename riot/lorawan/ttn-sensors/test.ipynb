    "\n",
    "Let's add the final step: read some sensor values from the [X-Nucleo extension shield](https://www.st.com/en/ecosystems/x-nucleo-iks01a2.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The X-Nucleo extension shield provides several ST Microelectronics sensors including the **HTS221** which measures temperature and humidity. The microcontroller interacts with this sensor using the [I2C serial bus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now edit the [Makefile](Makefile) and [main.c](main.c) to read this sensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To be able to use the _hts221_ sensor with RIOT, you must first load the corresponding RIOT module in the application's [Makefile](Makefile). Add the following line to the Makefile (under the addition of the `ztimer_msec` module):\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```mk\n",
    "USEMODULE += hts221\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "All dependency modules required by the sensor driver will be loaded automatically during compilation, in particular the I2C bus driver used by the board to communicate with the sensor.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In the [main.c](main.c) file, Add the necessary header inclusions first (just below `#includes \"semtech_loramac.h\"`):\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "#include \"hts221.h\"\n",
    "#include \"hts221_params.h\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Declare the variable containing the driver descriptor of the sensor (below the declaration of the `loramac` variable):\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "static hts221_t hts221;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. At the very beginning of the `main` function, add this sensor driver initialization sequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "    if (hts221_init(&hts221, &hts221_params[0]) != HTS221_OK) {\n",
    "        puts(\"Sensor initialization failed\");\n",
    "        return 1;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    if (hts221_power_on(&hts221) != HTS221_OK) {\n",
    "        puts(\"Sensor initialization power on failed\");\n",
    "        return 1;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "    if (hts221_set_rate(&hts221, hts221.p.rate) != HTS221_OK) {\n",
    "        puts(\"Sensor continuous mode setup failed\");\n",
    "        return 1;\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```\n",

    "This sequence is adapted from the [hts221 test appplication](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/master/tests/driver_hts221/main.c#L34-L45).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Finally, add the following code at the beginning of the `while` loop to read the sensor data. You can also delete the line `char *message = \"This is RIOT!\"`\n",
    "which is now useless:\n",
    "\n",
    "```c\n",
    "        /* do some measurements */\n",
    "        uint16_t humidity = 0;\n",
    "        int16_t temperature = 0;\n",
